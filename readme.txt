Link your WooCommerce store to Russian marketplaces and sell more. Adds link-buttons in the card to the same product on marketplaces

== Description ==
Sell on marketplaces? Link your WooCommerce store to them and sell more. The plugin allows you to add buttons-links to the same product placed on the marketplaces.

So buyers have a choice to buy in your store or from you, but on popular sites that they trust more or shipping is more convenient there.
